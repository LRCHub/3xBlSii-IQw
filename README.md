```lrc
[00:02.02] Walk in the shadowland, nobody's innocent
[00:04.73] Hand to mouth, we lived like demons
[00:07.17] Stuck in the phantom zone, lost in a thunder dome
[00:09.95] Twilight ruled the day
[00:20.95] 
[00:12.32] We found the impossible, now we're unstoppable
[00:15.32] Taking off, the world beneath us
[00:17.89] Strong under pressure, we'll make it together
[00:20.40] Our universe will change
[00:32.40] 
[00:23.10] Freedom looking down a telescope
[00:25.73] Starlight never been so beautiful
[00:28.46] Whole world waiting for us, time to go
[00:30.96] Escaping gravity
[00:38.96] 
[00:33.79] We'll be rising high above the rain
[00:36.12] Sunset never gonna be the same
[00:38.98] Thunder calling us to outer space
[00:41.48] Escaping gravity
[00:49.48] 
[00:51.96] Escaping gravity
[00:59.96] 
[01:02.43] Escaping gravity
[01:10.43] 
[01:05.34] Straight to the galaxy, faster than sanity
[01:08.04] Left behind a land forsaken
[01:10.67] Black holes and meteors riding on shooting stars
[01:13.35] Fearless like our dreams
[01:25.35] 
[01:15.69] We shoot down a satellite, wings of a butterfly
[01:18.68] Constellations recreating
[01:21.13] Fighting for liberty, raising the energy
[01:23.96] Bursting at the seams
[01:34.46] 
[01:26.40] Freedom looking down a telescope
[01:28.97] Starlight never been so beautiful
[01:31.68] Whole world waiting for us, time to go
[01:34.11] Escaping gravity
[01:42.11] 
[01:37.07] We'll be rising high above the rain
[01:39.60] Sunset never gonna be the same
[01:42.45] Thunder calling us to outer space
[01:44.64] Escaping gravity
[01:52.64] 
[01:55.25] Escaping gravity
[02:03.25] 
[02:05.77] Escaping gravity
[02:13.77] 
[02:08.67] Starlight dances in the silver of the night sky
[02:16.64] Way above the clouds, we will be sailing high
[02:21.78] Sailing high, sailing high, ooh
[02:37.28] 
[02:29.77] You and me, we're gonna touch the stars
[02:32.48] Find the center of the universe
[02:34.93] New reality in front of us
[02:37.44] Escaping gravity
[02:45.44] 
[02:40.28] We'll be rising high above the rain
[02:42.76] Sunset never gonna be the same
[02:45.52] Thunder calling us to outer space
[02:47.97] Escaping gravity
[02:55.97] 
[02:58.62] Escaping gravity
[03:06.62] 
[03:09.16] Escaping gravity
